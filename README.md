# Welcome to my public notes page!
I have always prided myself with my ability to understand complicated topics to the point I can break them down for others to understand. In high school I would help my other classmates understand topics or concepts that were more esoteric whether in my physics class or economics. As I have gone through college I have had to learn how to take notes properly and how to study more effectively as I didn't do either in my earlier scholastic career. As I have improved I have rediscovered my utility in helping my peers, and during my summer '24 semester while taking Operating Systems and Computer Networks I decided to share some of my notes with my class and several of my classmates informed me it helped them study for the exams. As such I have decided from the start of this semester to consolidate my notes into this webpage and make it publicly accessable for anyone who may benefit from my boiled down curriculum.

# About this Project
I write all my notes using markdown in a program called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and I am using Quartz v4.0 to turn these markdown pages into static HTML pages that I am hosting with the free level of my cloudflare account.
