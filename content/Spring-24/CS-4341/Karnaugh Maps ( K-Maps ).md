- Named after Maurice Karnaugh
- [K-Map Example Image](./k-map-image.png)
- The table gives you all possible values for the number of bits
- 2 input map
  - A'B' A'B
  - AB' AB
- K-Maps minimize terms graphically
- Fill up the k map by the truth table
- each neighbor has one term where a single variable switches from positive to negative, this is how we can remove the term
- Each adjacent 1 is ANDed together, the terms are then summed
  - Every 1 must be circled at least once
  - Every circle must span a power of 2
  - each circle must be as large as possible
  - A circle may wrap around the edges
    - for example in the second image, 100 and 110
- Can utilize "Don't Cares" [[Part 2- Combinational and Sequential Logic Designs#Logic to Gates]]
  - Want to enlarge the circles to include the Xs to include more terms.
  - However if an additional circle will grant no additional 1s then don't bother circling the x
