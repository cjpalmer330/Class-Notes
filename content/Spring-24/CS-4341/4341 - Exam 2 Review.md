# Pre test review
- K - Map
- Circuit design
	- Figure out how many inputs and outputs you have
	- Make sure you have a description of the function, either as a truth table or expression
	- Convert this into a simplified boolean expression
	- build the circuit based on the expression
- Combinational building blocks examples
	- Multiplexer
		- select between inputs
	- Decoder
		- one hot outputs from N inputs
- Sequential Logic
	- State Elements
		- Bistable circuit
		- SR Latch
			- Set reset
			- S = 0, R = 0, Q = Previous
			- S = 1, R = 0, Q = 1 ( Set )
			- S = 0, R = 1, Q = 0 ( Reset )
			- S = 1, R = 1, is invalid state
		- D Latch
			- Simply a SR Latch that removes the invalid case because the S and R both stem from one input. Also connected to the clock via and gate to allow timing to the switching
			- The Latch is transparent when the clock is high
		- D Flip-Flop
			- Made from two D Latches, connected in series
			- When clock = 0 first d latch is 0, and the value passes to the second d latch, on clock = 1 second d latch becomes transparent. So the value only passes out of the d flip flop on rising edge
			- The Flip-Flop only passes the value through on the rising edge on the clock, not just any time when the clock is at a high state
		- Registers
			- DFFs connected to a single clock line, where each DFF stores a single bit of information
	- FSM
		- Next state always depends on the current state and the inputs
		- Moore FSM: output depend Only on current state
		- Mealy FSM: output depend on Current state and the inputs
			- extra line from inputs to the output combinational logic
