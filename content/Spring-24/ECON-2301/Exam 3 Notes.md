- goods market
	- The market in which goods and services are exchanges and in which the equilibrium level of aggregate output is determined
	- fiscal policy
		- government spending and taxation
	- Y = C + I + G
- money market
	- the market in which financial instruments are exchanged and in which the equilibrium level of interest rate is determined
	- monetary policy
		- the amount of money in the economy, interest rates
-  AE = planned aggregate expenditure
	- always equal to C + I + G
	- AE = Y
	- R lower = I ^ = AE ^ = Y ^
	- Interest rate is the money market, Investment, AE, and Y goods market
	- Y^ = Md ^ = R^
- Expansionary fiscal policy
	- An increase in government spending or a reduction in net taxes aimed at increasing aggregate output
	- increases income
	- money demand
	- ^ G = ^ Y = ^ Md = ^ r = lower I
	- interest rate and the investment change is unwanted, and is called the crowding out effect
		- can be fixed by the federal reserve. " Fed accommodation "
- expansionary monetary policy
	- an increase in the money supply aimed at increasing aggregate output and thus bringing the interest rate back down
	- "easy monetary policy"
	- 4 federal tools for expansionary policy
		- lower required reserve ration
		- lower the discount rate
		- lower the federal funds rate
		- buying bonds ( increasing money supply)
- Contractionary policy
	- increase required reserve ratio
	- increase discount rate
	- increase FFR (overnight bank borrowing rate)
	- selling bonds ( removing money supply from the economy)
	- 
- Aggregate demand curve
	- A curve that shows the negative relationship between aggregate output and the price level. 
	- Each point on the AD curve is a point at which both the goods market and the money market are in equilibrium
	- why is the aggregate demand curve negative?
		- PL ^ = Md ^ = ^ r = lower investment
		- PL ^ = md ^ = ^ r = lower consumption
		- PL ^ = Purchasing power lower
	- Only shifts due to policy
		- expansion fiscal / monetary policy shifts to the right
		- contractionary policy shifts to the left
- two links between goods market and money market
	- Y = C + I + G -> Md
		- goods market affecting the money market
	- R -> I ( interest rates affect the amount of investment)
		- money market affecting the goods market
- IS-LM curve
	- Investment / Savings - Liquidity of Money Curve
	- x is aggregate output, y axis is interest rate
	- IS is negative, the lower interest rate, higher Y
	- LM is positive, higher interest rate, higher Y
	- Where they intersect is the equilibrium of goods and money market.
# Chapter 13
- Keynesian AS Curve
	- Y axis of price level
	- X axis of Aggregate output
	- exponential in the positive direction. starting out with slope ~ 0
	- Reasons for its shape
		- Wages lag behind price level changes
		- on the flat portion, the economy is not operating at full capacity. On the vertical slope, the economy is at full capacity
			- full capacity - economy reaches peak production and employment
	- What causes the Aggregate supply curve to shift
		- good weather / AS --->
		- increase in company input costs / <--- AS
		- energy prices increase / <--- AS
		- Technology development / AS --->
		- Tighter regulation / <--- AS
	- Expansionary policies work on the flatter, more recession indicative areas of the aggregate supply curve, because there is a large increase in aggregate output with a relatively small amount of PL increase.
	- Cost shock
		- a change in costs that shifts the short run aggregate costs
	- Demand pull inflation
		- inflation that is initiated by an increase in aggregate demand, when expansionary policy is done during the vertical portion of the keynesian supply curve. Expansionary during a peak.
	- Cost push / supply side inflation
		- with no change in monetary or fiscal policy, there is a shift in aggregate output in the aggregate supply curve.
	- The expansion fiscal policy, matched with expansionary monetary policy can cause a small increase in inflation. This cycle if not stopped causes a sustained, incessant inflation.

# Chapter 14
- Classical supply graph is completely vertical on the PL Y scale
- Wages Y axis, Labor X axis. Supply for labor, demand for labor, from the firm perspective.
- Sticky Wages
	- Wages stick at the original demand pay, but at now lower demand value, because people don't want to get a job at a lower wage. This causes unemployment.
	- Relative wage explanation of unemployment
		- An explanation for sticky wages, if workers are concerned about their wages relative to other workers in other firms and industries they may be unwilling to accept a wage cut unless they know that all other workers are receiving similar cuts.
- Cost of living adjustments
	- Contract provisions that tie wages to changes in the cost of living. The greater the inflation rate, the more wages are raised.
- Efficiency wage theory
	- An explanation for unemployment that holds that the productivity of workers increases with the wage rate. If this is 0, firms may have incentive to pay wages above the market-clearing rate.
- Phillips Curve
	- shows the relationship between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate.
	- PL ^ -> lower Unemployment
	- Inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment
	- If there is anticipation for inflation, the curve shifts to the right. IF there is not, the curve shifts to the left.
	- broke down in the 70s and 80s during stagflation. Became completely unreliable.
	- No real relationship between Price level and unemployment
