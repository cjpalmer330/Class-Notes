 - Aggregate output (y)
	 - The total quantity of goods and services produced in an economy
- Aggregate income (y)
	- The total income received by all factors of production in a given period
- consumption = MPC (y) + intercept
	- Marginal Propensity to Consume
		- fraction of income that is consumed
	- Marginal Propensity to Save
	- MPC + MPS = 1
- Planned investment
	- Those additions to capital stock and inventory that are planned by firms
	- if (y) < consumption + investment, planned investment > actual investment
		- (y) output, needs to increase
	- Interest rates and planned investment are negatively correlated
- Actual investment
	- The actual amount of investment that takes place, it includes items such as unplanned changes in inventories
	- if (y) > consumption + investment, actual investment > planned investment
		- (y) output, needs to lower to equalize with demand
- Planned aggregate expenditure
	- The total amount the economy plans to spend in a given period. Equal to consumption plus planned investment
- Investment Multiplier
	- The expected return for every dollar invested by a firm
	- 1 / MPS
- Change in Y = IM * Change in investment spending
- Change in Y = GM * Change in government spending
- Change in Y = TM * Change in taxation
- Gm - Government Multiplier
	- 1 / mps
- Tm - Tax multiplier
	- - ( mpc / mps )
- Yd - disposable income
	- income after taxes
	- ( Y - T )
- Y = C + I + G
- S = I
- C = a + bYd
- S = a + bYd
- Balanced Budget Multiplier = Gm + Tm = 1

## An Overview of Money
- Commodity Money
	- Has intrinsic value like gold, silver, crops like corn or wheat
- Fiat or token money
	- Items designated as money that are intrinsically worthless
	- Stamped with legal tender is what makes it worth something
- Legal tender
	- Money that a government has required to be accepted in settlement of debts
- M1 or Transactions money
	- Money that can be directly used for transactions
	- M1 = Cash outside banks + demand deposits + traveler's checks + other checkable deposits
- M2 or broad money
	- M1 plus savings accounts, monkey market accounts, and other near monies.
	- M2 = M1 + savings account + money market accounts + other near monies
	- The only time M2 changes is when expenses are made, movement between checking and savings does not change M2, only changes M1.
- When there is a recession
	- Increase the money supply in order to lower the interest rates.
	- Lowering interest rates increases consumption and investment which stimulates the economy
- When there is inflation
	- Retract the money supply in order to increase the interest rates.
- 4 Tools used by FED to control money supply
	1. g = required reserve ratio
		- Percentage that banks must keep with the federal reserve
		- When g raises, bank must keep more money with federal reserve, causing the Money supply to go down, thusly the interest rate goes up.
		- g ^ = Less MS = ^ interest rates
	2. Discount Rate
		- Rate that banks borrow from the FED
		- DR ^ = Less MS = ^ interest rates
		- DR down = ^ MS = lower interest rates
		- Kept higher than the FFR because it looks bad optically when the banks have to borrow from the government in order to make their payments
	3. Federal Funds Rate (FFR) key interest rate
		- The overnight rate at which banks borrow from each other
		- if FFR goes up, so does mortgage rate, car loans, student loans etc. Because the banks are having to pay more for their liquidity
		- FFR ^ = Less MS = ^ interest rates
	4. Open market operations
		- FED Buy bonds = ^ MS = lower interest rates
		- FED Sells bonds = lower MS = ^ rates
	- R = gD
		- R = require Reserves
		- g = required reserves ratio
		- D = deposits
	- Money Multiplier = 1/g
	- Excess Reserves = Actual Reserves - R
	- Loans = Excess Reserves * Money Multiplier
	- Total MS in bank = Initial Deposit * Money Multiplier
# Chapter 11
- Money Demand
	- Money you hold in M1 for transaction purchases. 
	- Opportunity cost of money you hold is the interest rate
	- uses X axis to determine level of Md
	- Movement along the Md curve is caused by a change in MS
	- Shift of the Md curve is caused by a change in Y (aggregate output/income) or PL ( Price Level) in the same direction
		- rise in aggregate output, ^ in Md
		- fall in PL, lower of Md
		- shift of the money demand curve
- MS = Deposit * MM
- for multiple banks  loans = deposit - R
- Fed actions affect MS, which affect Md
- Injection = Investment
- Leakage = Savings function ex. -100 + 0.25Y
