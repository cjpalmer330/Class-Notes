# BOOTP/DHCP
- assigning an IP address to your laptop when you connect to a network
- BOOTP is always static, but DHCP can do static or dynamic allocation
- DHCP has a pool of available addresses, and pulls a free one for the new host on connection. When a request comes in, the server first looks at static table.
