# CS 4390

## Overview

I took CS 4390 with Prof. Neeraj Gupta over the Summer 2024 semester, as such these notes are completed. For Networking I decided to separate my notes by OSI Model Layers, with certain subtopics getting their own pages if they were large enough

## [Class Overview](./Overview.md)

## [Layer 1](./Layer%201-%20Physical%20Layer.md)

## [Layer 2](./Layer%202%20-%20Data%20Link%20Layer.md)

## [Layer 3](./Layer3-Network.md)

### Topics

### [Subnet Masks](./Subnet%20Mask.md)

- As part of our layer 3 material there were quite a few students who were struggling with the concept of Subnet masks, so I extended my notes on the topic and created a separate page exclusively on the topic Here.

## [Layer 4](./Layer%204%20-%20Transport%20Layer.md)

## [Layer 5](./Layer%205.md)

## [Mobility](./Mobility.md)
