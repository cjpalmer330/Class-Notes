## About this site

This site is made using markdown files, which is how I take my notes in [Obsidian](obsidian.md). The files are converted into static HTML using Quartz which can be seen [here if you're interested.](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) Quartz has amazing documentation on how to set up, update, and host your own website like this if you wish, making it very simple. I am hosting this site using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and my hosting platform allowing me to use this url is [Cloudflare](cloudflare.com).

## About Me

I am just a mere computer science student at UTD, during my summer '24 semester other students in my class founds my notes helpful to study for exams so I decided to set this up to hopefully help other students this semester and in the future.
If you find any mistakes or have any questions about my notes or anything on this site, feel free to message me on discord #chrisp330.
