# CS 4348

## Formatting

I took 4348 Operating Systems over the summer of '24 with Prof. Prakash. He does not have comprehensive exams, rather two totally encapsulated exams. As such I wrote my notes in a Test 1 Notes / Test 2 Notes Format. Below you will find links to those two pages, and they are broken down by topic. There is also below reference as to where major topics are located.
