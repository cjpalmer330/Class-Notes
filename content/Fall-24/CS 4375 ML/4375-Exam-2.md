- Energy Based Models
  - There is some scalar valued energy function F(x,y)
    - Measures the compatibility between x and y
    - low values: y is a good prediction of x
  - training Energy based models
    1. parameterize F(x,y)
    2. get training data
    3. shape F(x,y) so that:
       1. F(x\[i],y\[i]) is strictly smaller than F(x\[i], y) for all y different from y\[i]
       2. F is smooth
  - Two learning methods
    - Contrastive methods- push down on points F(x\[i], y\[i]) for push up on other values of y
    - Architectural Methods- build F(x,y) so that the volume of low energy regions is limited or minimized through regularization
- Denoising Autoencoder
