# Types of Learning
## Supervised Learning
- Training a model by showing it examples of something. When the output is wrong, tweak the parameters of the machine.
- Need to hand engineer the feature extraction mechanism
### Deep Learning
- Needs multiple non linear layers so that they cannot be collapsed into a single matrix function
- weights of each input of each layer can change with each iteration as the model is learning.
