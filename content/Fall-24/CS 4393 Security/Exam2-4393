# Secret Key Cryptography

- Claude Shannon
  - proved in 1937 with his Master's thesis that electrical switches could solve boolean algebra
  - This along with two additional paper were the foundation of _information theory_
  - Proposed Confusion and Diffusion system

## Diffusion and Confusion

- Concerned with strong ciphers against statistical analysis
  - Strong cipher: knowledge of how the cipher is made should give no evidence of how to decode. The solution should give no hints to the key or plaintext
- Shannon proposed a "product cipher" - a block cipher consisting of a sequence of simple operations
-

## Diffusion

> [!important] Diffusion
> Statistical characteristics of plaintext is hidden by having each plaintext letter effect the encoding of many ciphertext letters.

- can be accomplished by repeatedly transposing the data, many bits in plaintext will contribute to each ciphertext letter.
  - Good diffusion is determined if a change in a single plaintext letter has on average ~0.5 letters change in the ciphertext

## Confusion

> [!important] Confusion
> relation between statistics of the ciphertext and the key. The more complex the higher the confusion.

- Can be achieved with a more complicated substitution algorithm.
